# It's Nerf or Nothin!

In this repo is some basic code to get the AI nerf turret working. Fork it and add whatever your heart desires.

# Getting Started

Install the following dependencies using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, run `python main.py` with the arduino and webcam plugged in. Make sure to specify the correct camera and port for the Arduino.

There are a couple of other scripts that are useful for testing the servos and firing independently.
